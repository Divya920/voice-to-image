# Voice-to-Image Project

This project converts spoken voice input into images using AI-based processing. Users can describe an image verbally, and the system generates a visual representation of that description.

## Features
- Convert voice commands or descriptions into images
- Supports natural language voice input
- Generates images using AI models
- Saves generated images locally

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Speech Recognition (`speech_recognition`)
- Text-to-Image AI model (e.g., OpenAI DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion)
- OpenCV / PIL for image handling

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-to-image.git
   cd voice-to-image
